# fish-fillets
A collection of FISH $SHELL Alias'


You can migrate all your Fish SHell Alias to a new install from coping all the files in: 
~/.config/fish/functions
and
/root/.config/fish/functions

Which have all you alias saved as files. And of course cp these to root and user account so they are the same.

cp -v MEDIA/root/.config/fish/functions /root/.config/fish/functions

cp -v ~/.config/fish/functions ~/.config/fish/functions

Even better, learn to sync the spefic folders.
